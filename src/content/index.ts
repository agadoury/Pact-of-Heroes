/**
 * Pact of Heroes — content registry. Pure exports; no logic.
 *
 * Heroes and cards are registered separately. Each hero module is
 * responsible for registering its own signature status tokens at import
 * time (see `heroes/berserker.ts` for the pattern). Card pools live in
 * `cards/` and are looked up by hero id at deck-build time — they are
 * NOT carried on `HeroDefinition`, so the deck-builder feature can swap
 * card lists without touching hero data.
