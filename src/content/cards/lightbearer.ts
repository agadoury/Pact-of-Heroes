/**
 * Pact of Heroes — Lightbearer cards.
 *
 * Hero-specific card pool. Loaded by the content registry via
 * `getDeckCards("lightbearer")`. Cards live here (not on `HeroDefinition`)
 * so the upcoming deck-builder feature can swap card lists per match
 * without touching hero data.
 *
 * Implementation notes (per the §15 engine extensions):
 *  - Sanctuary uses `persistent-buff.pipelineModifier` (§15.3) +
 *    `discardOn: next-turn-of-self` (§15.5).
 *  - Aegis of Dawn uses `reduce-damage.multiplier` (§15.1) injected from
 *    an Instant response window (Clarification B).
 *  - Vow of Service uses `ability-upgrade` + `passive-counter-gain-amount`
 *    rather than `triggerModifier`, since the Radiance grant on
 *    Prayer of Shielding lives inside the defense's effect compound, not
 *    on `cpGainTriggers[]`. The mechanical outcome is identical.
 *  - Sunburst uses `combo-override` (§15.6) +
 *    `discardOn: end-of-self-turn` (§15.5).
 *  - Cathedral Light fans out into three per-defense `ability-upgrade`s
 *    via a top-level compound; this is cleaner than scoping
 *    `all-defenses` and disambiguating with compound StateChecks the
 *    engine doesn't currently express ("zenith count: 0" anti-clause).
 *  - Solar Devotion / Sunblade Mastery / Cathedral Light all rely on the
 *    `passive-counter-gain-amount` ability-upgrade field — added to the
 *    AbilityUpgradeField whitelist alongside the Lightbearer ingestion.
