/**
 * Pact of Heroes — damage pipeline.
 *
 * Order of operations on incoming damage:
 *   1. Pure damage:         skips Shield + Protect. Directly subtracts HP.
 *   2. Undefendable damage: skips the defender's chosen-defense reduction
 *                            (the defensive flow is short-circuited entirely
 *                            for this damage type — see phases.ts beginAttack),
 *                            but Shield + Protect still apply.
 *   3. Normal damage:       Shield (passive flat) → Protect (consumed) → defender's
 *                            chosen-defense reduction (computed by phases.ts and
 *                            passed in via `defensiveReduction`) → HP.
 *   4. Ultimate damage:     same as normal but reactive cards may be locked out;
 *                            the defender still picks one defense (or "take it").
 *                            (Spec note: ultimate is currently classified as
 *                            non-defendable in beginAttack — it skips the picker.)
 *
 * Healing clamps to hpCap (start + 10).
