/**
 * Pact of Heroes — phase progression.
 *
 * The phase order:
 *   pre-match → upkeep → income → main-pre → offensive-roll → defensive-roll
 *               → main-post → discard → (next player's upkeep) → ...
 *
 * Most transitions are auto. The exceptions:
 *   - main-pre → offensive-roll: requires the active player to tap ROLL
 *     (action: "roll-dice") OR end-turn-without-rolling (rare; not in MVP).
 *   - main-post → discard: requires the active player to tap END TURN.
 *
 * Defensive roll is auto-resolved (no defender input). Returns the mitigation
 * amount + the matched defensive ability info for the choreographer.
